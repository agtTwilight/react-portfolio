        <p>Hello, my name is Lukas. I am a Seattle-based software developer open to work with any layer of the tech stack. I prefer working in teams following an agile development process, and my ideal position would have me working as a full-stack developer with an emphasis on the back-end. Currently I am most profecient with JavaScript (inlcuding React.js & Node.js), MongoDb, and mySQL databases, but I have previous experience with MATLAB, Python and R, and I am confident in my abilities to learn new tools and contribute to any team!
